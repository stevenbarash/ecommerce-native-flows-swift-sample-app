# Descope's Native Flows Swift Sample App

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Welcome to Descope's Native Flows Swift Sample App, a demonstration of how to integrate Descope [native flows](https://docs.descope.com/build/guides/gettingstarted/) for user authentication within a Swift application. Native flows are authentication UIs built in the Descope flow editor and rendered inside your app via `DescopeFlowViewController` or `DescopeFlowView`. By exploring this project, you can understand how Descope works with Swift to manage native flows. For an example with all authentication methods, refer to the [Swift Sample App](https://github.com/descope-sample-apps/swift-sample-app).

## Features
This sample app includes:

- **Simple Flow**: Push a `DescopeFlowViewController` onto a navigation stack
- **Modal Flow**: Preload a flow in the background and present it modally when ready
- **Inline Flow**: Embed a `DescopeFlowView` directly in the view hierarchy with custom animations
- **Passkeys**: Native passkey sign-in using the Descope SDK
- **Enchanted Link**: Email-based magic link authentication
- **Native Login**: Password sign-in and SMS OTP backed by the Descope SDK directly (no hosted webview)

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the sample app and explore Descope's capabilities with Swift:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Xcode
- an iOS Simulator

### Run the app

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the project within Xcode
3. Within the project settings of the project, change the `myProjectId` (If in a non-US region, or using a custom domain with CNAME, replace `myBaseURL` with your specific localized base URL)

![Alt text](.github/images/setProjectId.png?raw=true "Set Project ID")

4. **(Optional) Self-Host Your Flow**: Your Descope authentication flow is automatically hosted by Descope at `https://auth.descope.io/<your_descope_project_id>` but you can use your own website or domain to host your flow. You can modify the value for the flow URL in the Flow Controller files to include your own hosted page with our Descope Web Component, as well as alter the `?flow=sign-up-or-in` parameter to run a different flow.

```swift
let flow = DescopeFlow(url: "https://api.descope.com/login/\(Descope.config.projectId)?flow=sign-up-or-in")
```

> For more information about Auth Hosting, visit our docs on it [here](https://docs.descope.com/auth-hosting-app)

5. Run the simulator within Xcode - The play button located in the top left

7. Change the value of the `appInterface` value in `AppInterface.swift` to see other examples of authentication screens

### Notes:

1. Enchanted link currently does not route back to the application. You will need to validate the token externally from a web or backend client.
